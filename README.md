# AVC Toolchain Arch

A bit more complicated than I expected it to be.
The `Pololu USB AVR Programmer v2.1`'s drivers already exists within the Linux kernel, but the .tar-ball from their site
provided with `pavr2cmd` and `pavr2gui`. At first, the `TTL port` and `Programming port` stated `(Unknown)`. As a last
restort, I rebooted the computer and finally Arch dedicated a **port** to it.
